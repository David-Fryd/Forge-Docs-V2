Forge is a lightweight modeling language, similar to [Alloy](https://alloytools.org), that has been designed for _teaching_ modeling and lightweight formal methods. It comprises three sublanguages or modes:

* **Froglet** (`#lang forge/bsl`), a core language for modeling using object-oriented intuitions;
* **Forge** (`#lang forge`), an extension of Frglet to include relations and relational operators;
* **Temporal Forge**, an extension of Forge to include linear-temporal operators (akin to Alloy 6 or [Electrum](https://github.com/haslab/Electrum)).

Students progress through this language hierarchy as new concepts are introduced in class; this lets the course avoid a steep language-learning curve and cover important practical material earlier than would otherwise be possible.\


{% hint style="warning" %}
#### The original documentation is in need of hierarchical refactoring and better contextual explanations. _(i.e. Better section names - "Built-In" = ?...)_&#x20;

**TODO:**&#x20;

* [ ] Add general overview page - what is a model? what is a predicate? What is an instance? What is a predicate? Very brief high level overview page (all material obviously covered in class, but supplementary nonetheless- maybe even pull from class notes?)
* [ ] Refactor Sigs page v1
  * [x] Sigs Basic
  * [x] Fields Basic
  * [ ] Elaborate 'Types' on Sigs Page
  * [ ] Provide Clearer Description for 'Field Multiplicity' on Sigs Page
  * [ ] Provide Clearer Context for "Low level details" - seems out of place and confusing. Maybe move it in addition to expanding upon it
* [ ] Provide Description for 'Arity' on Sigs Page (I would even consider adding a whole new page/entry for 'Arity' since its a fundamental concept that will also appear in certain error messages and such)
* [ ] ...
* [ ] Go through the rest of the pages and expand this TODO list
* [ ] Refactor/Categorize rest of the pages more intuitively&#x20;
